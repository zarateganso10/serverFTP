The lower bracket final of group B kicked off on Dust2, where Özgür "woxic" Eker ensured a strong start for his team with a Glock quad kill. A follow-up pistol buy from Grayhound fell through, allowing the Europeans to further add to their lead. Round after round, the Australian defence struggled to come up with solutions to the T onslaught, leading to an 8-0 lead for their opposition. Rounds 9 and 12 were the only two that Grayhound saw success in over the course of the initial half, the latter courtesy of an outstanding triple kill from Christopher "dexter" Nong.

An impressive pistol round performance from woxic saw three members of Grayhound fall to his P2000 as he closed the lid on the first map of the series. The Australians were unable to pose a threat in the two upcoming rounds, leading to a swift 16-2 conclusion on map one for mousesports.
